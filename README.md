## **Project Overview**

CryptoNexus is a cryptocurrency tracking application that fetches real-time data from CoinGecko API and displays it in an interactive dashboard. This application provides users with up-to-date information on various cryptocurrencies, focusing on Bitcoin data to help users make informed decisions in the crypto market.

This project serves as a multistep learning journey, initially built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to establish core functionality and understand fundamental concepts. In future iterations, it will be migrated to React to enhance the user interface with component-based architecture, state management, and more dynamic interactions. This evolution reflects a real-world development process where applications grow from simple prototypes to sophisticated web applications.
